6	NonCoding_score	A	Float	Score for non-coding variants. The MKL algorithm integrates functional annotations from ENCODE with nucleotide-based HMMs. Predictions are given as p-values in the range [0, 1]: values above 0.5 are predicted to be deleterious, while those below 0.5 are predicted to be neutral or benign. P-values close to the extremes (0 or 1) are the highest-confidence predictions that yield the highest accuracy.	single-overlaps
7	NonCoding_Groups	A	String	Distinct predictors for positions either in coding regions (positions within coding-sequence exons) and non-coding regions. The non-coding predictor uses a subset of 4 feature groups, A-D. Predictions based only on a subset of features may not be as accurate as those based on complete feature sets.	single-overlaps

9	Coding_Groups	A	String	Distinct predictors for positions either in coding regions (positions within coding-sequence exons) and non-coding regions. The coding predictor is based on 10 groups of features, labeled A-J. Predictions based only on a subset of features may not be as accurate as those based on complete feature sets.	single-overlaps
