4	RS	1	Float	GERP identifies constrained elements in multiple alignments by quantifying substitution deficits. Rejected substitutions (RS) are a natural measure of constraint that reflects the strength of past purifying selection on the element. These values are based on the mammalian alignments available at UCSC in late 2010.	single-overlaps
