5	Rawscore	A	Float	Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a framework that integrates multiple annotations into one metric by contrasting variants that survived natural selection with simulated mutations. Raw values have relative meaning, with higher values indicating that a variant is more likely to be simulated (or not observed) and therefore more likely to have deleterious effects.	single-overlaps
6	PHREDscore	A	Float	Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a framework that integrates multiple annotations into one metric by contrasting variants that survived natural selection with simulated mutations. Raw scores for all SNVs were PHRED-scaled by expressing the rank in order of magnitude terms rather than the precise rank itself.	single-overlaps
